Title: A Framework for Building HTTP API
Description:
  Allows to easily create high-performance full featured HTTP APIs from R
  functions. Provides high-level classes such as 'Request', 'Response',
  'Application', 'Middleware' in order to streamline server side
  application development. Out of the box allows to serve requests using
  'Rserve' package, but flexible enough to integrate with other HTTP servers
  such as 'httpuv'.
