#' @title starts RestRserve application
#' @description Assuming that RserveApplication is deployed to a \code{dir},
#' \code{restrserve_start} starts Rserve from it. Application "deployed" means that
#' directory contains \code{Rserve.conf} file which has been generated with
#' \link{restrserve_deploy} function
#' @param dir character, path to the directory where application was deployed
#' @param debug logical, \code{FALSE} by default. Whether to start \link{Rserve} in debug mode.
#' @param ... other parameters to \link{Rserve} call
#' @return named integer. Value is a PID of the Rserve daemon. Name is a path to a file where PID is stored.
#' After start Rserve creates a file with its PID. By default tt is called "Rserve.pid" and created inside \code{dir}.
#' This could be specified in \link{restrserve_deploy} during application deployment.
